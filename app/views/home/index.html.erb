                                Aloop's 4SMX tank/seat kit is a totally new concept in Motocross racing accessories. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-0">
                                This kit features a smaller than stock 2.0 gallon plastic fuel tank, a new seat based around the CR250 style seating position, and it utilizes shrouds from a CR to enhance engine cooling and overall style.

                            <p class="mb-0">
                                The Aloop 4SMX Kit uses your stock petcock, fuel cap and mounting hardware. The new tank includes a right side petcock for better fuel flow. Total fuel capacity is only .8 gallons less than stock, but in a greatly improved ergonomics package. A great looking Aloop graphics set and non-slip seat cover round out the kit. All parts made in the USA. Get one and go fast!

                            <h2 class="h5 color-red">No “Humpback” Seat Like the Awkward Stock Setup.</h2>
                            <p class="mb-3">
                                With the Aloop 4SMX kit, the rider can sit a full 3" further forward on the narrow, flat seat, without encountering the awkward hump of the stock setup. The new fuel tank is 3" narrower than stock tank, and the new seat places the rider 3/4" higher as well for a greatly improved ergonomic feel. CR250 style radiator shrouds direct cooling air to the engine, and provide a place for mounting of additional oil coolers. Best of all, the new fuel tank is dramatically slimmer, and riders will find it much easier to grip the tank in the rough sections.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-0">
                                This improves the handling and you will easily ride your machine faster. A Motocross Seat Tank kit may just be the most noticeable mod you make for your race bike.

                            <p>"The kit arrived by late Friday, indeed much sooner than expected, so I must say I’m quite impressed by shipping service. I’ve been also quite impressed by the general quality of fit, finish an engineering of the Aloop kit. Thanks to it I have an altogether new bike!</p>
                            <p>I decided to take my time and enjoy the work, so I spent best part of the weekend mounting the kit. Thanks to the sense of humour of the instructions I must say it was a double enjoyment. In short, thanks for an outstanding product and a no less outstanding service."</p>
